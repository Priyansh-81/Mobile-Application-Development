    <string name="digital_transformation_description">Digital transformation is the cultural, organizational and operational change of an organization, industry or ecosystem through a smart integration of digital technologies, processes and competencies across all levels and functions in a staged and strategic way. It is a journey with multiple connected intermediary goals, in the end, striving towards continuous optimization across processes, divisions and the business ecosystem of a hyper-connected age where building the right bridges (between front and back office, data and decisions, people, teams, technologies, various players in ecosystems, etc.) in function of that journey is key to success. Digital transformation is not just about technology. It is about a mindset shift, a change in strategy, and a new way of doing business.</string>
